# Chance's Fantastic Steam API App

It just queries the Steam public API right now, lol. BUT it uses some modern web stack stuff like:

* React
* Node
* Typescript
* Prettier
* Zod
* Axios

Additionally, it proves I can do stuff like:

* Build a web page using a framework I previously had zero experience with using
* Use a back-end server to get around CORS errors
* Streamline development via careful use of npm and external libraries
* Work with publicly-available APIs and data to serve up an interactive UI
* Use componentDidMount to get data once, instead of pulling it a million times because I put it in the render loop by mistake (could happen to anyone, tho)

Future goals for the project:
* more robust traversal of Steam API data
* nested components that make clever use of state
* probably refactoring those components to lift the state to where it actually should be
* make it not the literal ugliest thing on the internet

If you like what I'm doing, that means a lot to me, thanks. You're always so good at complimenting me in a way that validates my creative output, rather than my intrinsic qualities.
